        <h1 id="title">GitHub vs GitLab and Bitbucket</h1>
        <p id="text">I consider GitHub to be the top choice for hosting websites compared to other platforms like GitLab and Bitbucket. GitHub boasts an incredibly active and engaged developer community, hosting over 100 million repositories, the majority of which are open-source projects. This truly reflects the trust and preference developers and companies have in GitHub. Additionally, one feature I find particularly appealing is GitHub's ability to create web pages directly from my repositories, which greatly simplifies the process of sharing and publishing content. GitHub supports a wide range of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like Jekyll.
        <br><br>When comparing it to GitLab, I notice that although GitLab also has an active developer community, it originated more as a self-hosted open-source platform. This means I have the option to host a private version of GitLab on my own virtual machines. Moreover, GitLab is designed to handle the entire DevOps cycle, allowing me to manage everything from planning to deployment and monitoring of my software. 
        <br><br>Regarding Bitbucket, I appreciate the integration it offers with other products like Trello and Jira. This can be a significant advantage for teams already utilizing these applications. However, I've observed that Bitbucket offers different pricing options for self-hosted and cloud instances, whereas GitHub has a simpler pricing structure, albeit slightly more expensive for larger teams.</p>
        <h2 id="title">Why did I choose GitHub?</h2>
        <p id="text">I chose GitHub, because GitHub is an excellent platform for hosting websites, and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, GitHub Pages allows you to host your site for free. Additionally, GitHub facilitates collaboration, as anyone can open a pull request to update the site, making teamwork and contribution from others to your project easier. Another major advantage is synchronization with the repository. This means that whenever you make a change to your repository, those changes are automatically reflected on your site. GitHub Pages also supports custom domains, although it comes with a default domain name. It's important to know that GitHub Pages is a static website hosting service and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from a repository on GitHub. Finally, GitHub offers flexibility, allowing you to host your personal website, your company or organization's site, or a project you want to showcase to your team.</p>
